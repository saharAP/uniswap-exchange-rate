Okay
use web3 to show real time pair exchange rates on uniswap.
Need to show these paris
1. ETH to DAI
2. YFI to ETH
3. CRV to ETH
The rate should refresh on every block
Also user should be able to connect metamast and another wallet
Need to use react+hooks
for implement this feature
no need special design
needed just real-time exchange rate
you need to interact with uniswap
After finish the test, we can go ahead with long-term position on this contract
