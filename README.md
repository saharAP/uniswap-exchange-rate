# Real-time Uniswap Pairs Exchange Rates

## About

This is a sample project in order to compute the exchange rates of the three pairs(ETH/DAI,YFI/ETH,CRV/ETH) on Uniswap.
The rates are updated once a new block confirmed.

## Exchange Rate Calculation
Each pair in Uniswap has its own liquadity pool. 
So that, if you want to calculate the exchange rate of each pair, you must calcuate the quanity ratio of the two tokens of a pair.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dependencies

In order to install the project requirements, run the command in the project root directory

### `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

**You must connect your wallet to the mainnet if you want to run the project correctly!**

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
